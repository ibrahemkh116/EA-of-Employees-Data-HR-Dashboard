# EA of Employees Data (HR Dashboard) :
In this project, I used power query in MS Power BI to extract data tables from Excel files and did the cleaning & transformation work. Then, in data model I used DAX to create some measures to be used in analysis. Finally, I used power view to make the storytelling and visualization full of insights.
